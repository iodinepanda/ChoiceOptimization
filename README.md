A Choice Optimization Algorithm being developed to schedule hall staff duties.
The code uses a genetic algorithm to develop schedules of duty. It is functional but still in development and not ready for full deployment. There are plans for website integration.

A general application package for external use is in the works so that this project can be applied to other scheduling problems. Working code will be uploaded soon.
