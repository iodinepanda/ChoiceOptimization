A Choice Optimization Algorithm being developed to schedule hall staff duties.
The code uses a genetic algorithm to develop schedules of duty. It is functional but still in development and not ready for full deployment. There are plans for website integration.

A general application package for external use is in the works so that this project can be applied to other scheduling problems. Working code will be uploaded soon.

TODO:
- Write JUnit tests on small test data (find optimal solution, ensure that COA falls with some range of it)
- Implement full genetic function on top of current mutation-only approach
- Make wiki explaining the process of extending the choice_optimization package (long term, not urgent)
